# good-react-app

create-react-app without the bs, with some candy

## ðŸ¤”why?

create-react-app had always been a go-to tool for me to spin up a react project, but i used to always find myself deleting all the unnesesarry files like the `reportWebVitals.js` and `setupTests.js` and not to mention, the assets for that pretty spinner, css and so much more :(

so, i thought why not make this boilerplate public and free for use?

## what's in it for you?

â€¢ you don't need to delete the above mentioned files <br />
â€¢ css reset classes are already setup and no unnesasarry gibbersih for you to handle

## usage 

1. Clone this project
2. run `npm i` or `npm install`
3. run `npm start`
4. voila! that's it, go ahead and create the best project you can

## ðŸ˜ this sucks?

have any bright ideas to make this template better? go for it, fork this project and submit a PR
